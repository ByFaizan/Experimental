# Experimental
### this repo is for deploying little pieces of interesting code you'll find:

***SimpleCalculator:*** a very basic math operator which would take your integers,
apply a simple math operation on them and finally display the output on the browser using HTMl 

***InterestCalculator:*** you'd see the interest you've earned via compound int.

***Statistics Standard Deviation:*** just a fancy way in math to find about how much you data is going off of the middle-line(mean)
